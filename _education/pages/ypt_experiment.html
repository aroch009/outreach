  <p class="lead"> Finding chalcid wasps is as easy as using small yellow bowls filled with soapy water, in fact this technique is even what the pros use! </p>

  <p>The following experiment aims to investigate the diversity of Hymenoptera in different habitats (grass field versus flowers, dripping faucet, desert, chaparral, concrete, native flora, etc). This experiment uses pan traps, which are a small yellow bowls with water and a drop of soap, supplied to teachers by UCR (contact- <a href="mailto:johnheraty@ucr.edu">John Heraty</a>). This experiment would be conducted by groups of students and results combined across each class. Ideally, teachers would present the <a href="/education/biodiversity.html">“Biodiversity Module” presentation"</a> before this pan trap experiment. Teachers have the following resources available for this pan trap study:</p>
