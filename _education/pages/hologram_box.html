  <p> Make a hologram box! </p>

  <p> The hologram pyramid is made from four clear plastic sheet that are cut into a shape of  isosceles trapezoid. When the four clear isosceles trapezoids are combined to form a pyramid shape, it can be place on the center of a smart phone screen for a three dimensional projection of an image or video. The three dimensional projections is merely an illusion from the light of the phone. Each side of the pyramid is projected with an identical image. The four projections work in unison to form a whole image, which is how the mid-air 3D illusion of an image is created. </p>
