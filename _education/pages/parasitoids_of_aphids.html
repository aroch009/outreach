  <p> Aphids are among the most destructive insect pests on cultivated plants in temperate regions. Around 250 species are serious pests for agriculture and forestry as well as an annoyance for gardeners. Tiny parasitoids that are biteless and stingless hunt out aphids and lay their eggs inside the aphids. The resulting parasitoid larvae hatches and eats the aphid from the inside, eventually killing the pest. </p>

  <p> Teachers can demonstrate this amazing form of biological control to their students by ordering a ‘banker plant’ system from Biopest. </p>
