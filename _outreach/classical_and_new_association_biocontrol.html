<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>

<p>When pests are to be controlled over large areas, the only long-term effective approach is introduction of natural enemies. If the target pest is an invasive non-native species and its natural enemies from its country of origin are introduced, the approach is called <mark>classical biological control</mark>. If the target is a native pest and the natural enemies released against it come from a different species, the approach is called <mark>new-association biological control</mark>.</p>

      Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) was first detected in California in August 2008. In 2011, a host-specific parasitoid of ACP, <i>Tamarixia radiata</i>, was sourced from Punjab, Pakistan and released to help suppress urban ACP populations across southern California.

      The <i>Acacia</i> tortoise beetle (ATB) was first detected in New Zealand in 1996. In 2000, the Australian egg parasitoid <i>Enoggera nassaui</i> was released in the field to evaluate parasitism of ATB. <i>Enoggera nassaui</i> has no evolutionary history with ATB and is a new-association biocontrol agent.
