# Outreach

This is an experiment.  The goal is to deliver resources for education and outreach on the Chalcidoidea via a Jekyll website using simple Markdown documents as content.

# Run locally

Assumes you have Ruby, bundler installed.

```  
git clone git@github.com:chalcid/outreach.git
cd outreach
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

In your browser goto http://127.0.0.1:4000/. 

# Developing the website 

This is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) website that uses [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) for style. 

When the Jekyll server is running then editing any file automatically triggers a rebuild of the site.

## Adding content with Markdown

A majority of the content here is written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

### Taxon Pages

To add a taxon page add a Markdown formatted file to the `_diversity` directory.

### Education modules

To add a module add a Markdown formatted file to the `_modules` directory.  Ultimately you will also add individual elements as well, where is yet to be determined.

### Outreach

... coming, will follow Education pattern 

## Assets (images, documents, presentations) 

See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to contribute binary files that will be content for the site.
