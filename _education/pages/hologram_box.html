  <p> A hologram projector is a fun and interactive way to fully appreciate the complexity and beauty of small wasps. The hologram projector can be made from an old CD or clear plastic cut into a shape of isosceles trapezoid.  It can be place on the center of a smart phone screen for a three dimensional projection of an image or video. Use our examples below or have students make their own by simply putting the same images in all four directions suing the template below. The middle square is where the hologram pyramid is placed. Images with black backgrounds tend to work the best. Creating the images can be done in Powerpoint. </p>
