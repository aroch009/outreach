<p>When natural enemies are absent (as in greenhouses) or too scare to provide control, their numbers may be increase artificially by releasing insectary-reared individuals. Release of commercially produced natural enemies is called augmentation biocontrol. <mark>Inoculative release</mark> involve small numbers of natural enemies with the expectation that their offspring will continue to control the pest for an extended period of time.  <mark>Inundative release</mark> usually involves large numbers of natural enemies because reproduction of the released individuals is not likely to occur.
