title: How does the hologram pyramid work?
summary: The hologram pyramid is made from four clear plastic sheet that are cut into a shape of  isosceles trapezoid. When the four clear isosceles trapezoids are combined to form a pyramid shape, it can be place on the center of a smart phone screen for a three dimensional projection of an image or video. The three dimensional projections is merely an illusion from the light of the phone. Each side of the pyramid is projected with an identical image. The four projections work in unison to form a whole image, which is how the mid-air 3D illusion of an image is created.

This is a video explaining how to make a hologram from a CD case. To avoid injuries for the students and the teachers, substitute CD case with shrink clear plastics.

Students can simply make any images into a hologram image by putting the same images in all four directions. The middle square is where you can put the hologram pyramid. Images with black backgrounds tends to work the best. Placing the images can be done in Powerpoint.
