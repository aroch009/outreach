## Introduction

Identifiable by its long ovipositor,Torymidae is a family of wasps that have a unique metallic sheen to their bodies. Clocking in at about 2-3 mm long, Torymidae hold a multitude of genera that range from parasitizing mantis eggs to gall forming. One thing to point out is the latest developments in the Torymidae family. 

## A New Classification

Prior to 2017, Torymidae was thought to contain two subfamilies Megastigminae and Toryminae. However, using molecular systematics, it was shown Megastigminae are unrelated and both are now elevated to family status (Jansta et al. 2017) 

## Biology

Belonging to the order Diptera, Torymidae are known as ectoparasitoids that inhabit plant galls. Torymidae tend to exhibit phytophagous behavior, also known as feeding on plants. Females choose a plant to host and lay their egss where larvae with segmented legs can emerge and feed on plants to become adults. Research is further being done to match each species of the Toryminae family to its specific host. 
 
## Morphology

•	Tarsi with 4 or 5 tarsomeres
•	Body often black or with metallic luster or much longer than 1 mm
•	Long ovipositor 
•	Antenna with 11 flagellomeres


## Vocabulary

Ovipositor- a tubular organ through which a female insect deposits eggs.
Parasitoid- an insect whose larvae develops on and exploits the host. 
Gall- abnormal growths that can arise in all parts of a plant 
Taxonomy- classifying organisms through systematics 
Systematics- study of the diversification of living forms, both past and present, and the relationships among living things through time
Tarsi- final segment in the leg, essentially the feet of insects
Flagellum- the segments that are whip like that make up the ends of the antennae
