# Outreach

This is the source repository for the [Chalcid Outreach](http://outreach.chalcid.org) website.  

## Contributing.

Our goal is to have you, the user of the website, become an active curator of this resource.

_It is important to remember that all contributions will become CC-BY-NC content, do not contribute or propose something for which you do not have rights._

### Adding content through the issue tracker

This is the primary mechanism for adding pages of a specific type, i.e. those that follow a template.  You will have to have a [Github account](https://github.com/join) to add an issue.

* Open the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/chalcid/outreach/issues) and choose a template for the type of page you would like to add.
* Follow the instructions in that template, replacing the text with your new content.  Do this to the best of your ability, it need not be perfect. 
* Submit the issue, at this point the site curators may ask for clarification in the discussion of that issue, and may make minor tweaks to the page.
* Once the page is finished the curators will move the content in the issue into a new file in this repository, and the page will become visible.  
* The issue will then be closed.

You can start editing a new template directly from these links:

* [New Biodiversity Page](https://github.com/chalcid/outreach/issues/new?template=new-biodiversity-page.md)

### Suggesting a modification through the issue tracker.

* Use the [Suggest modification](https://github.com/chalcid/outreach/issues/new?template=suggest-modification.md) template to suggest changes including adding or deleting content for an existing page, or requesting a change to the site.

### Adding media content (images, files) in the TaxonWorks chalcid project

_documentation in progress_

* You'll need access to the `chalcid` project, email Matt or Nic for details.

### Modifying the website directly
