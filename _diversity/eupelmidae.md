## Introduction

Eupelmidae is a large family containing more than 900 species that can be found around the world, with 119 of those species occurring in Canada and the United States. Members of this group have diverse life histories and are divided into 3 subfamilies as follows: Calostinae, Eupelminae, and Neanastatinae. Most are internal or external parasites of the immature stages of moths, butterflies, true bugs, beetles, lacewings, grasshoppers, cockroaches, gall midges, and other wasps. Some are egg parasites of several insects or spiders. Others are hyperparasites, parasites whose host is also a parasite. While most Eupelmidae are tiny, the largest of its members is about 6 mm in body length and belongs to the genus _Metapelma_.  Species vary in color from dull brown to brightly colored and even metallic. 
## Biology

Members of the subfamily Eupelminae have a unique jumping mechanism which is powered by the contraction of the large acropleural muscles. These muscles stretch energy storing blocks made of resilin. When triggered the energy is released pulling the thorax and causing the head and abdomen to bend over it which results in a rapid movement of the mid legs causing it to jump. These modifications will often cause Eupelminae to die in a bent shape with the head and abdomen held upwards.
## Economic Importance

Species of Eupelmidae have been used as biological control agents of agricultural and forest pests. For example, _Anastatus_  _disparis_ is an egg parasitoid  used to control the  gypsy moth (_Lymantria_ _dispar_), one of the most destructive insects in the eastern United States. It can defoliate over one million acres of forest a year causing millions in damage.
