  <p> Teachers can demonstrate biological control of aphids to their students by ordering a ‘banker plant’ system from Biopest. The small banker plant system (4 x 5 x 3 inches) contains a barley plant inoculated with 50-100 cherry oat aphids feeding on the barley plant (~$20 + shipping). The barley plant can be cut into 2-4 pieces and repotted if the teacher would like small groups of students to demonstrate parasitism. Teachers then can order 500 aphid parasitoids for $25-30 + shipping which arrive as pupae. When adult parasitoids start to emerge from the pupae they can be placed into cages with the inoculated barley plants and students can observe parasitism. If desired, students can also rear the developing parasitoid larvae, and observe adult parasitoid emergence from parasitized aphids mummies.</p>

    There is a minimal of $50 per order, therefore teachers may need to combined orders.
