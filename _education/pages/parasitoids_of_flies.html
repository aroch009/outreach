  <p>  Fly parasitoid wasps are nature’s own enemy of all common manure and rotting organic matter breeding pest flies, including the common house fly, horn fly, biting stable fly and lesser house fly. Fly parasitoids hunt out and attack fly pupae (cocoons) before the flies emerge and reproduce. They are tiny, completely biteless and stingless. They never become a pest themselves or bother people or animals. </p>
